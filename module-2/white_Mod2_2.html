    <p class="intro">
      Hello, my name is Rachel White. My home state is Wisconsin. I have 5
      siblings; three are living, and two are not. My little sister passed away
      in February of this year.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy spending time with my niece,traveling, working out/exercising,
      cooking, sewing, learning new things, and spending time outdoors.<span

        Life is challenging, but fresh air and sunshine does wonders for the
        mind, body, and soul.</span
      >
      I'm looking forward to doing some hiking this summer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spend time on my computer for work, but I prefer only to spend a limited
      amount of time on electronics if possible. Technology has its upsides and
      downsides, so I use it when needed, such as work and learning new things
      such as programming, but I like to set boundaries when it comes to my life
      and electronics/technology in general.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy the four seasons of the year. Living in Wisconsin, I experience
      all of the seasons, which sometimes isn't much fun when you have to drive
      in snow, but you get use to it. I enjoy when it starts snowing for the
      year; there's so much beauty in fresh snow as it falls and lands.
